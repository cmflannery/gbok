# Mathematics Guidlines
This is a general guide that lists some useful mathematics. This is a useful reference when you don't know what tools to use to approach a problem.

__Note to self:__ add notes on implementation and applications for each section.

## Theorems

## Formulas

### Taylor Series Approximation
This is a super useful and important formula. Add information about this at some point. Latex formatting somehow?


## Computational Tools
I primarily use Matlab, Python (Scipy Packages), and Mathematica for computation.

### Matlab
* Simple syntax
* Don't forget that it is __1 indexed__

### Python
* Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib essentially give the features of Matlab
 * opensource so it's simple/possible to see implementation

### Mathematica
* _Great_ for symbolic manipulation... seriuosly... use this whenever you have to do symbolic manipulation
  * Remember the SE160A project.
